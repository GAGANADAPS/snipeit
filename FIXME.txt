remove Ziggy
and ziggy-js too
And what is /public/js/snipeit.js ? That looks like a generated file

The 'flash' (forced refresh/fake refresh) on uploads is dumb
I'm not sure if the order on the uploaded files is right?
The Livewire.first() thing is still dumb (but Id o'nt know that we can fix it).

Deletes need to work (I got this working before using $.ajax; it's not even hard)

Then mapping and so on.
